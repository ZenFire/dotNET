# ZenFire .NET API (for API2)

This is not ready for use.  It's being developed in public by ZenFire in collaboration with other developers.

For more info on API2, see https://forums.zenfire.com/wiki/API2/FAQ.

## Build libzenfire .NET library (libzenfire.dll)

* Extract the 64 bit MD build of `1.9.42.23` to `C:\`, resulting in a path like `C:\libzenfire-1.9.42.23-windows-32bit-vc10-MD\` existing.
* Open libzenfire.sln in Visual Studio 10.
* Set build to Release, x64
* Build!

Other configurations and platforms will work later.  More flexibility for working with varied versions of the C++ ZenFire API is also planned.
